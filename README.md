## Mirai
 - Stable: No
 - Maintained: Yes
 - Worth checking out: Maybe?

Has a lot of patches derrived from [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) optimizations. Also implements from [C2ME](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric) which is a fabric mod to improve chunk performance. Would definitely not use in production.
